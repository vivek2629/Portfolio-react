## What we done till now

--> we have created pages for both login and sign-up

# now we should make them work
 * In sign-up page
    --> get the user details from sign-up page and store them in local storage 
    --> provide a mark that an account is created successfully

* In login Page
    --> when ever user fill the details and click on login
    --> we have to check weather the details available in local storage or not
    ---> if available then redirect to Home page
    ---> else show an error message saying Create an Account First
* finally, Log in Page and Sign-Up page are Ready
